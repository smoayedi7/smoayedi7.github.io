		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p> The Bodhi House is a place of collective creation and connection. We host various events, including art workshops, yoga sessions, film screenings, and gatherings of other sorts.

		<h3>What Does Bodhi Mean?</h3>
		<p>Bodhi is a sanscrit word (Sanskrit: बोधि) that roughly translates to "awakening." The bodhi tree was the tree the Buddha spent hours meditating under. In Buddhism, the bodhi tree is a symbol of enlightenment or awakening. In our understanding, awakening is a processes of realizing all that is false, and connecting to the ever-present Truth. </p>
